/*
Homework 1: Math operations
Write a program that reads 2 numbers and print their + - * / as following
Input
12 & 3
Output
12 + 3 = 15
12 - 3 = 9
12 / 3 = 4
12 * 3 = 36
Do good testing for your code
E.g. consider zero as first or 2nd number
E.g. consider negative values
E.g. even and odd values
E.g. try the MAX of int: 2147483647
